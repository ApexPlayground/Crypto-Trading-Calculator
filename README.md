# Crypto Trading Profit and Loss Calculator

    This is a tool for calculating the profit or loss on your cryptocurrency trades. 
    It uses previous year's data and Pyqt6 to create a user-friendly interface 
    for entering your trade details and seeing your results.
    
## Getting Started

    To use the calculator, follow these instructions:

    Clone this repository.
    Install Pyqt6: pip install PyQt6
    Run crypto_trading_calculator.py.
    Enter your trade details, including the date, currency, amount, price, and any fees.
    Click "Calculate" to see your profit or loss.

## How it Works

    The calculator uses historical cryptocurrency data to determine the price of the currency on the
    date of your trade. It then calculates the profit or loss based on the difference between the 
    price you bought or sold the currency for and the price on the date of the trade. It also takes 
    into account any fees you paid for the trade.
    
## Features

    Easy-to-use interface for entering trade details.
    Uses historical data to calculate the value of your trades.
